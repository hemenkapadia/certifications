# Coursera Repository

This will be my master repository to store all assignments and statement of accomplishments once I have completed a Coursera course successfully. 


Since some courses explicitly require us to fork an existing repositoyry, and due to github limitations with forking, it may so happen that many course level repositories will get created at the top level, but once the course is completed or a specialization track is completed I plan to move all my work into this directory.
